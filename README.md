# github-profile-viewer

## 1. Summary

This project is a single-page web application generated to fulfill the following brief:

> Create a single-page application that allows users to look up a GitHub profile. The page must contain a text input for the username (`#username-input`), a submit button (`#lookup-btn`), and a container div (`#profile-container`). When the button is clicked, fetch user data from `https://api.github.com/users/{username}`. Inside the container, display the user's avatar (`<img>`), name (`<h1>`), bio (`<p>`), and number of public repositories. Use Bootstrap 5 for basic styling.

This application was built and deployed automatically as part of a multi-round, automated evaluation task for *Round 1*. The entire frontend is self-contained within the index.html file.

## 2. Setup

No local setup is required to run this application. It is designed for direct deployment and viewing on GitHub Pages. All necessary dependencies (such as CSS frameworks or external libraries) are loaded from Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

## 3. Usage

To use the application, navigate to the deployed GitHub Pages URL:

[*View the live application here*](https://22f3000510.github.io/github-profile-viewer/)

The page will load, and the application will be ready for interaction as described in the summary.

## 4. Code Explanation

The entire application logic, styling, and structure are contained within the index.html file.

-   *HTML*: Provides the fundamental structure and content of the page, including forms, buttons, and containers as specified in the brief.
-   *CSS*: Styling is either included within <style> tags or loaded from a CDN (e.g., Bootstrap) as required.
-   *JavaScript*: All dynamic functionality, including event handling (e.g., button clicks, user input) and API interactions (fetch calls), is handled by plain JavaScript embedded within <script> tags.

The code was generated by an LLM to specifically address the project requirements and pass a series of automated checks.
